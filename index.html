        <h1>Euro 2020</h1>
        <p>The 2020 UEFA European Football Championship was exceptionally held in 11 venues across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament.</p> 
        <p>While the tournament was received positively for its high scoring matches, criticism and attention has been drawn towards the unequal distribution of travelling distance across teams. 
            While some teams have to travel upwards of 5000km for the group phase alone, others were allowed to play the entire phase at home.</p>
